# CS210-Corner-Grocer

Project Overview --
In the Corner Grocer project, I developed an easy program that keeps track of grocery items and figures out their prices, similar to how a grocery store manages the checkout process. This program helps organize the items, their amounts, and the overall costs, ensuring everything runs efficiently.

What Went Well --
I’m really happy with how organized my code is. It runs smoothly and does exactly what I wanted – it tracks and calculates grocery prices. Writing C++ code was tough at times, but I believe I managed it well, keeping everything neat and working properly.

Areas for Improvement--
If I could make the program better, I would focus on the way the data is stored. Currently, I am using basic data structures, but I believe that implementing a hash table would speed up the lookups. This change would help the program perform better, especially as the inventory grows in the future.

The Toughest Challenge --
The toughest challenge in this project was managing the file input and output. For instance, reading the data from the files and ensuring everything was parsed correctly proved to be difficult. I overcame this by looking up information on file handling in C++ and conducting extensive tests to ensure the program worked with various types of data.

Skills I Gained--
This project really helped me improve my skills in a few key areas, like handling files, writing clear code, and debugging. These skills will definitely come in handy for future projects, especially when I’m working with data or need to manage large files.

How I Made the Code Simple to Update--
I added comments all over the code to explain the logic and any complicated sections. This will be really helpful if I need to revisit the program later to make updates or add new features. The key is to keep the code clear and easy to change in the future.
